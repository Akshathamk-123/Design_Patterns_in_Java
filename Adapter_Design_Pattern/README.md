# Adapter Design Pattern

The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to integrate third-party components or legacy code with new systems.

## Key Concepts

1. **Target Interface**: The interface that the client expects or needs to work with.
2. **Adaptee**: The existing interface or class that needs to be adapted. It has methods that are incompatible with the target interface.
3. **Adapter**: The class that implements the target interface and translates requests to the adaptee. It acts as an intermediary that adapts the adaptee's interface to the target interface.
4. **Client**: The code that interacts with the target interface, expecting the adapter to handle communication with the adaptee.

## Implementation

### Example in Java

#### Target Interface

```java
// Target Interface
public interface Target {
    void request();
}
```

#### Adaptee

```java
// Adaptee Class
public class Adaptee {
    public void specificRequest() {
        System.out.println("Specific request from Adaptee");
    }
}
```

#### Adapter

```java
// Adapter Class
public class Adapter implements Target {
    private Adaptee adaptee;

    public Adapter(Adaptee adaptee) {
        this.adaptee = adaptee;
    }

    @Override
    public void request() {
        adaptee.specificRequest();
    }
}
```

#### Client

```java
// Client Class
public class Client {
    private Target target;

    public Client(Target target) {
        this.target = target;
    }

    public void makeRequest() {
        target.request();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Adaptee adaptee = new Adaptee();
        Target adapter = new Adapter(adaptee);
        Client client = new Client(adapter);
        client.makeRequest();
    }
}
```

## Advantages

- **Compatibility**: Allows integration between incompatible interfaces, making it easier to work with existing code or third-party libraries.
- **Flexibility**: Enables code reuse and enhances flexibility by providing a common interface for different implementations.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Separates the adaptation logic from the target interface, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

## Disadvantages

- **Overhead**: Adds an extra layer of abstraction, which can introduce additional complexity.
- **Performance**: May introduce a slight performance overhead due to the additional indirection.

## Common Use Cases

- **Legacy Code Integration**: Adapting old systems or libraries to work with new applications.
- **Third-Party Libraries**: Integrating third-party libraries with incompatible interfaces into your application.
- **Object Composition**: Facilitating communication between objects that have different interfaces within the same system.

## Conclusion

The Adapter Design Pattern is a versatile tool for achieving compatibility between incompatible interfaces. By using an adapter, you can integrate diverse components and systems while maintaining a clean separation of concerns. This pattern is particularly useful for integrating legacy code or third-party libraries into modern systems, enabling smooth interactions and enhancing the flexibility of your codebase.
