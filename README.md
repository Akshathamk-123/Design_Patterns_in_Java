# Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They provide best practices for structuring code to solve recurring design issues. Design patterns are categorized into three main types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. Each category addresses different aspects of software design.

## Design Patterns

### Creational

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They abstract the instantiation process and help manage object creation more effectively.

**Creational Patterns:**
- Singleton
- Factory
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

### Behavioral

Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects, what goes on between objects, and how they operate together.

**Behavioral Patterns:**
- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Template
- Mediator
- Memento
- Visitor
- Strategy
- Observer
- State
- Iterator

### Structural

Structural patterns deal with object composition or class composition, aiming to ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to change.

**Structural Patterns:**
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy
