# Strategy Design Pattern

The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables an algorithmâ€™s behavior to be selected at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

## Key Concepts

1. **Strategy**: An interface that defines a family of algorithms or strategies. It declares a method that can be used by the context.
2. **ConcreteStrategy**: Classes that implement the Strategy interface. Each class encapsulates a specific algorithm or behavior.
3. **Context**: Maintains a reference to a Strategy object and uses it to perform an operation. It may delegate the execution of the algorithm to the Strategy object.

## Implementation

### Example in Java

#### Strategy Interface

```java
public interface Strategy {
    void execute();
}
```

#### Concrete Strategies

```java
public class ConcreteStrategyA implements Strategy {
    @Override
    public void execute() {
        System.out.println("Executing Strategy A");
    }
}

public class ConcreteStrategyB implements Strategy {
    @Override
    public void execute() {
        System.out.println("Executing Strategy B");
    }
}
```

#### Context

```java
public class Context {
    private Strategy strategy;

    public Context(Strategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void setStrategy(Strategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void performOperation() {
        strategy.execute();
    }
}
```

#### Client

```java
public class StrategyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a context with a specific strategy
        Context context = new Context(new ConcreteStrategyA());
        context.performOperation();

        // Change the strategy at runtime
        context.setStrategy(new ConcreteStrategyB());
        context.performOperation();
    }
}
```

## Advantages

- **Flexibility**: Allows changing the algorithm or behavior at runtime.
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulates the algorithms or strategies, making them easy to understand and modify.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Adheres to the Open/Closed Principle by allowing new strategies to be added without modifying the Context class.

## Disadvantages

- **Increased Number of Classes**: Introducing new strategies requires creating new classes, which can lead to a proliferation of classes.
- **Context Complexity**: The Context class must be designed to handle multiple strategies, which can increase its complexity.

## Common Use Cases

- **Payment Processing**: Different payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal) can be implemented as strategies.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Different sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort) can be implemented as strategies for sorting data.
- **File Compression**: Various file compression algorithms (e.g., ZIP, RAR) can be used as strategies for compressing files.

## Conclusion

The Strategy Design Pattern provides a way to define and encapsulate a family of algorithms, making it easy to select and change algorithms at runtime. By promoting flexibility and adherence to design principles like the Open/Closed Principle, it helps in managing varying behaviors in a clean and modular way. However, it can increase the number of classes in the system and may add complexity to the Context class.
